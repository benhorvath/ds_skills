A big part of your role will be choosing the most appropriate technique, based on business need and available data, to develop custom data models and algorithms. As part of that, you’ll also create processes and tools to monitor and analyse model performance and data accuracy. All the time, balancing time to deliver with level of detail and accuracy.
Working with different functional teams, you’ll implement your models and monitor their outcomes – making sure we’re conforming to data security standards at all times. Thinking about the newest technology, you’ll make sure we’re maximising our efficiency and productivity and provide subject matter expertise across the business whenever it’s needed.
What you’ll need
To do all this, you’ll need:
Bachelor’s degree in Analytics or related quantitative fields (statistics, Operations research, mathematics, econometrics etc.). An advanced degree is preferred.
2-3 years experience in applied data science role or equivalent. Ideally, it would be in CPG, Telecom or Financial services
Knowledge and experience in modelling techniques and advanced applied skills. For example significance testing, GLM/Regression, Random Forest, Boosting, Trees, text mining and social network analysis, using tools like Spark, Scala, SAS, R, Python, Bayesia, H2O, Storm, Yarn, and Kafka
Experience using key external third party data sources including Nielsen/ IRI/ Storeviews, Kantar, Homescan Panel, Retail Execution, Shopper card, first party data and consumer surveys
Experience querying databases (SQL, Hive) and working with big data platforms such as Hadoop ecosystem (Azure), including in-memory solutions (SAP HANA and Apache Spark)
Working knowledge of data visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, D3, ggplot, to deliver output to the broader business community to improve decision making and productivity
