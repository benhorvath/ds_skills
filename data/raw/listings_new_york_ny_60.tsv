Who We Are

Murmuration is an organization dedicated to sustainable policy change in the U.S., and we believe that the path to real change in America’s education system is through political activism and participation. Together with our partners, we develop shared infrastructure and coordinated support for organizations on the ground to massively improve outcomes for all children. We do this by working directly with local schools and organizations to amplify the voices of parents and families as key stakeholders in setting education policy.

As part of our work, Murmuration has developed a technology product called “m{insights” that seeks to aggregate data from a combination of sources including member data from partner organizations, publicly available data, consumer data, voter file data, and more. The compiled data are then used to build a variety of analytic models and tools that enable Murmuration’s partner organizations to activate, expand, and mobilize their supporter bases effectively for sustained political change.

About the Position

We are looking for a creative and endlessly inquisitive Data Scientist, with a machine learning emphasis, to join our team. You will be working hand-in-hand with our Senior Data Engineer and Senior Data Scientist to develop highly optimized predictive models from a large volume of regularly updated data.
