Our work has been featured in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Atlantic, Harvard Business Review, PBS NewsHour, TechCrunch, and several other outlets.

We're looking for a Data Scientist to join our team, leading analyses of people-related data and providing analytical support on a number of projects. Are you passionate about using data to help companies become more inclusive? Our data science team is the place for you.
Here are some of the things we do​:We conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses on client data to assess diversity and inclusion across the employee lifecycle, from how companies attract and hire people to how they develop and retain their workforce. This includes meeting with clients to explain our data needs, conducting a wide range of analyses on data from multiple sources, and contributing to written reports and presentations.
We provide insight into the analytical approach to take on both client-facing and non client-facing projects. This includes weighing in on appropriate statistical analyses, interpreting analyses, data visualization, and follow up analyses.
We collaborate on multiple projects concurrently (e.g., research projects, long-term client projects, ad hoc analyses).
About you​:Technical Skills:You have experience and comfort working in the R computing language. You can clean, manipulate, and merge data, conduct a wide variety of analyses, visualize data, check assumptions of statistical tests, and write and debug functions.
You're interested in developing reproducible tools and notebooks for internal use, using version control tools like Git/Github, and pulling data via APIs.
You have statistical training as a part of an advanced degree (e.g., multiple regression, factor analysis or principal components, correlation, and nonparametric analyses).
