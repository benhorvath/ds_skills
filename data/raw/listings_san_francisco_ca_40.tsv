We take on big problems to help drivers, riders, delivery partners, and eaters get moving in more than 600 cities around the world. We welcome people from all backgrounds who seek the opportunity to help build a future where everyone and everything can move independently. If you have the curiosity, passion, and collaborative spirit, work with us, and let’s move the world forward, together. About the Role Maps provide the backbone of Uber’s service, from the driver and rider experience and display to the route recommendations and travel time predictions from one point to another. These routes and predictions feed into all of Uber’s decision systems, like dispatch, UberPool matching, and pricing. Our turn-by-turn navigation service allows drivers to effectively navigate while on or off trip, while our geosearch engine allows users to search for a destination or pickup point. To power these services, Uber Maps also generates base map data (the road map definition and features) and point of interest data (such as restaurants or hotels). A sister team, Sensing Inference and Research (SIR), provides location estimates for Uber’s users while they are engaging with the app; these location estimates also power the user experience and decision systems. SIR also does sensor inference modeling to support a wide variety of products, such as accident or fraud detection. Maps plays a critical role in providing a smooth and comfortable rider and driver experience on Uber’s platform, from the moment they open the app till the moment they arrive at the destinations.We’re looking for data scientists (all levels welcome!) to contribute to all aspects of Uber Maps.

You will also be building systems for analysis and monitoring of core performance metrics. What You'll Do Develop metrics and experiment design that facilitate product improvements. Provide data analysis to improve business processes and decisions. Work alongside engineering teams, product managers and operations to drive the direction of product improvements via mathematical and statistical modeling. Develop creative solutions to product problems using advanced mathematical algorithms such as machine learning and optimization. Build and validate prototypes to demonstrate the benefits from proposed changes to decision systems and operational processes. Work independently, as well as in collaboration with other data scientists. Communicate with senior management and cross-functional teams. Sample projects in the team Define metrics for travel time prediction accuracy and route quality, and link them to business impacts Design turn costs and objective functions for route recommendation, and link them to impacts on downstream services such as pricing and dispatching Develop novel machine learning algorithms to mine user generated content and improve places data accuracy Work with downstream consumers of Maps to launch experiments, measure marketplace impacts, and interpret results Develop machine learning algorithms to infer and refine driver and rider locations when GPS signals are weak or inaccurate. What You'll Need M.S. or Ph.D. degree in Statistics, Machine Learning, Operations Research, or other quantitative disciplines. Alternatively, a BS with 5 or more years of experience in relevant fields. Knowledge of underlying mathematical foundations of statistics, machine learning and optimization.
