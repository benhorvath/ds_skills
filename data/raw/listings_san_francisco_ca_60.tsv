About the Team
Maps provide the backbone of Uber’s service, from the driver and rider experience and display to the route recommendations and travel time predictions from one point to another. These routes and predictions feed into all of Uber’s decision systems, like dispatch, UberPool matching, and pricing. Our turn-by-turn navigation service allows drivers to effectively navigate while on or off trip, while our geosearch engine allows users to search for a destination or pickup point. To power these services, Uber Maps also generates base map data (the road map definition and features) and point of interest data (such as restaurants or hotels). ''
A sister team, Sensing and Perception, provides location estimates for Uber’s users while they are engaging with the app; these location estimates also power the user experience and decision systems. Sensing and Perception also does sensor inference modeling to support a wide variety of products, such as accident or fraud detection. Our teams play a critical role in providing a smooth and comfortable rider and driver experience on Uber’s platform, from the moment they open the app until the moment they arrive at their destinations.You can learn more about us through:
