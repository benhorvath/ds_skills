An incredible team of fun, humble but brilliant co-workersBackground

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs. Vital to igniting growth. Vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future of billions around the globe.

But, Innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees have lots of ideas on how to improve a business, but with no formal process, their suggestions go unheard and they give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation labs are expected to support countless different activities to promote innovation but lack the right tools for the job. Executives are seeing disruption everywhere they look and investing millions, but still have no idea where their “next big thing” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a platform that’s solving those problems. We’ve been helping corporate R&D teams be more efficient with the 1.5 Trillion dollars invested annually.

Our Team

We’re a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded, team of self-starters who show up every day for the same reason: to create an impact on the way the world innovates. Our aim this year at Brightidea is to make it our Best Year Ever and we plan to accomplish that through our creative, focused, ambitious, and humble approach to change the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone entering our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you can identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful than this could be the perfect team for you to add your contributions to and shine in.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody."
