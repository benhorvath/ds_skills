Who we're looking for:
We are looking for people who understand that behind every data point there is a pet and a pet person. When you develop and deploy an algorithm, you are not just producing a score or rule set, you are altering the customer experience and impacting the business in measurable ways. You should be excited to tackle a broad array of problems and work in a fast-paced, collaborative startup environment.
