Textio’s category-defining augmented writing platform is delighting customers, and we’re looking for a Director of Data Acquisition with a strong sense of ownership to join our Seattle team.
At their core, Textio’s linguistic data sets are real-world documents paired with their real-world performance outcomes. As Textio’s augmented writing platform extends to more and more kinds of writing, these linguistic data sets are the foundation on which our entire platform and user experience are based. Whether Textio’s platform is being applied to job posts, emails, or any other kind of writing, it all starts with the data.
In this role, you will build linguistic data sets from the ground up using whatever techniques are required. You will work with our customers to collect data where appropriate. You will design and run crowdsourcing experiments to build labeled data sets and will take advantage of publicly available data sources where it makes sense. You are scrappy and you see labeled data sets where other people don’t even think to look.
Our Director of Data Acquisition knows how to turn these labeled data sets into testable hypotheses. If you can look at a piece of writing and immediately understand which linguistic variables are likely to influence its performance, then you can work with ML and NLP engineers to test your hypotheses against the data sets you have assembled.
Finally, you will turn Textio’s models into writing guidance that real people can use. Textio writers are not linguists, statisticians, or data scientists. We can’t assume they are familiar with linguistic concepts. The Director of Data Acquisition will translate predictive models into real writing guidance—and come up with clever ways to automate this process along the way.
We’d love to hear from you if:
You have a strong background in empirical linguistics, experimental design, and/or user experience
You have previously shipped production software that real people have used
You have experience building text corpora from the ground up, including use of crowdsourcing platforms to build tagged data sets
You are not a theoretical purist, and understand that the best product experiences come from blending approaches in machine learning, NLP, and linguistics
You are comfortable working closely with data and infrastructure engineers, but you speak better human than machine
You know how to ship a project on schedule, and you have a deep desire to own and lead
You’re at ease writing scripts (in R, Python, or similar) and SQL to bring value out of data
You are an excellent communicator verbally and in writing—Textio stands for editorial quality, and you do too
You’re committed to quality as a top priority—you pay attention to what you make, and take pride in it
You have a track record of experimenting, building, and learning new things
You have a point of view but are low ego
This is a leadership role on our growing Product team.
We’re not looking for ninjas or rock stars. We want an awesome and trustworthy Director of Data Acquisition to lead our most critical language experience work from design all the way through implementation.
Textio embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. The more inclusive we are, the better our work will be. If there is anything we can do to create a more comfortable interview experience for you, please let us know.

Who we're looking for:
We are looking for people who understand that behind every data point there is a pet and a pet person.
