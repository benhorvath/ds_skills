Cures Start Here. At Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch’s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation’s first cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women’s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Careers Start Here.
Seattle Translational Tumor Research (STTR) creates environments which enable researchers and clinicians to accelerate scientific discovery and translate it into cures for patients; and has three main objectives:
Build seamless infrastructure to optimize and speed translational and precision medicine research
Strengthen tumor-specific translational research programs across liquid and solid tumors
Strengthen partnerships between Seattle-area translational research institutions
STTR is currently implementing a survey of Fred Hutch-based faculty and staff. The survey is intended as a landscape assessment and needs gathering activity to inform STTR and Fred Hutch leadership about the current state of informatics needs and support across Fred Hutch.
Our goal is to use the results to inform the development of the translational research pipeline by better understanding bottlenecks and barriers to large-scale translational research. By understanding which data types are most commonly used in research projects, we can help inform the development of new tools in Oncoscape (http://oncoscape.sttrcancer.org/#/) to enable more novel approaches to data visualization and analysis (in partnership with interested informatics/computational faculty). We can also use the data to work with groups across Fred Hutch (HDC and the Translational Genomics Data Coordinating Center) to help researchers access the tools and technologies needed to navigate this space, and to help develop and increase access to best practices and data standards in this space. In addition, this survey will allow STTR to more effectively connect investigators (both clinical and wet lab) to resources for informatics support across the Fred Hutch investigator network.
To date, we have surveyed over 60 clinicians, researchers and staff across Fred Hutch and have conducted preliminary analyses of findings using the quantitative data generated from our survey. We hope to take our analysis deeper and draw further connections amongst investigators through further analysis of this data set and through analysis of the qualitative data collected through the survey. Working alongside various groups at Fred Hutch, such as Center IT, the Hutch Data Commonwealth, and faculty from the Computational Biology division we plan to use this information to identify or develop effective bioinformatics solutions that advance researcher’s abilities to conduct large-scale translational research.
Responsibilities
Conduct further quantitative analysis of survey data
Begin qualitative analysis of survey data – using an established coding system and online program (no prior experience required)
Summarize and create a report on findings
Present findings to relevant stakeholders at Fred HutchQualifications

Rover.com connects pet parents with the nation’s largest network of pet sitters and dog walkers. On Rover, pet parents can easily discover, book, and manage personalized care for their dogs including pet sitting, dog walking, and doggy day care. Founded in 2011 on the belief that everyone should have the opportunity to experience the unconditional love of a dog, Rover improves and simplifies life for pet parents and the dogs they love.
We're headquartered in downtown Seattle. We're an agile, fast-growing startup, and our leadership comes from some of the country's most respected tech companies. Our Senior Leadership team has been recognized by Forbes, Seattle Business, and Geekwire. For the past three years we have been nominated as one of Seattle's \"Best Places to Work\" by Seattle Business Magazine, and celebrated awards in 2016 and 2017 by Seattle Met magazine and the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're also the recipient of World’s Most Dog-Friendly Offices in 2016 by Inc.com. Needless to say (but we're going to say it anyway)—we love dogs, and we wouldn't dream of going to work without them by our sides.
Who we're looking for:
We are looking for people who understand that behind every data point there is a pet and a pet person. When you develop and deploy an algorithm, you are not just producing a score or rule set, you are altering the customer experience and impacting the business in measurable ways. You should be excited to tackle a broad array of problems and work in a fast-paced, collaborative startup environment.
What does Data Science mean at Rover?
At Rover we obsess over our customers’ needs, relying heavily on data to improve the customer journey, and to continuously optimize outcomes in our marketplaces. Our entire organization is metric driven and underpinned by data science. Data scientists are responsible for defining the right metrics, understanding nuanced marketplace dynamics, and developing models and algorithms that power our business and technology.
As a Data Scientist You Will:
Identify opportunities to operate the marketplace more efficiently, working closely with business, product, and engineering leaders
Build multivariate models to arrive at inferences or predict future behavior
Develop algorithms that match owners with providers or solve other customer needs
Design and analyze A/B user tests and marketplace experiments, often in partnership with product managers
Deploy machine learning models at scale, writing production code in collaboration with machine learning platform engineers
Your Toolset Includes:
SQL
Python or R
Google Analytics or similar user funnel analytics tools
Tableau, Looker, or similar data visualization tools
Data-informed decision making with rigorous split testing.
Integrated teams with developers, designers and analysts working side-by-side.

B.S in a quantitative discipline required; advanced degree (MS or PhD) preferred
Strong analytical, technical and coding skills
Expertise in one or more core data science disciplines (e.g, supervised learning, machine learning, etc)
Marketplace experience preferred
Experience in online user testing preferred
2+ years of experience in a technical role
Why We’ll Hire You:
You are familiar with more than just the basics, and have more than cursory experience with at least sub-discipline in the broad field of data science. In other words, you know where the sharp edges are, and can lead decisions around what techniques are and are not appropriate to employ for particular classes of problem
You’re a deeply analytical thinker who is passionate about finding structure in data, and using data to drive real value to the end user (and thus the business).
You are passionate about our core business. You will instinctively dig into every aspect of what it means to be a dog sitter and a dog owner on the Rover platform.
You can take abstractly defined problems and work with (imperfect) data to drive decisions
You are a great partner to engineers and business owners alike
You can pitch your own ideas and shepherd them through to completion
You show a pattern of being self-started, self-taught and self-directed
You favor open communication with willingness to ask and answer questions
You are output- and outcome-oriented
You have excellent written and verbal communication skills
You play nicely with others (and dogs)
