Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities — we're just getting started. Facebook relies on a strong ecosystem of developers to build on top of our experiences to enable business.

We are looking for a thought leader who can break down complex systems and ambiguous problems into actionable insights that can be used to better understand the ecosystem and direct strategic decision making. Some examples of big questions that we are hoping to answer in the next year are: How do B2B apps and developers differ in their behaviors from B2C apps and developers? How do developers and the ecosystem impact the ability of businesses to grow on Facebook?

At Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch’s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation’s first cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women’s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Careers Start Here. Seattle Translational Tumor Research (STTR) creates environments which enable researchers and clinicians to accelerate scientific discovery and translate it into cures for patients; and has three main objectives: Build seamless infrastructure to optimize and speed translational and precision medicine research Strengthen tumor-specific translational research programs across liquid and solid tumors Strengthen partnerships between Seattle-area translational research institutions STTR is currently implementing a survey of Fred Hutch-based faculty and staff. The survey is intended as a landscape assessment and needs gathering activity to inform STTR and Fred Hutch leadership about the current state of informatics needs and support across Fred Hutch. Our goal is to use the results to inform the development of the translational research pipeline by better understanding bottlenecks and barriers to large-scale translational research. By understanding which data types are most commonly used in research projects, we can help inform the development of new tools in Oncoscape (http://oncoscape.sttrcancer.org/#/) to enable more novel approaches to data visualization and analysis (in partnership with interested informatics/computational faculty). We can also use the data to work with groups across Fred Hutch (HDC and the Translational Genomics Data Coordinating Center) to help researchers access the tools and technologies needed to navigate this space, and to help develop and increase access to best practices and data standards in this space. In addition, this survey will allow STTR to more effectively connect investigators (both clinical and wet lab) to resources for informatics support across the Fred Hutch investigator network. To date, we have surveyed over 60 clinicians, researchers and staff across Fred Hutch and have conducted preliminary analyses of findings using the quantitative data generated from our survey. We hope to take our analysis deeper and draw further connections amongst investigators through further analysis of this data set and through analysis of the qualitative data collected through the survey. Working alongside various groups at Fred Hutch, such as Center IT, the Hutch Data Commonwealth, and faculty from the Computational Biology division we plan to use this information to identify or develop effective bioinformatics solutions that advance researcher’s abilities to conduct large-scale translational research. Responsibilities Conduct further quantitative analysis of survey data Begin qualitative analysis of survey data – using an established coding system and online program (no prior experience required) Summarize and create a report on findings Present findings to relevant stakeholders at Fred HutchQualifications Current student (Master's level preferred) Knowledge of qualitative analysis methodsOur Commitment to Diversity We are committed to cultivating a workplace in which diverse perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected.
