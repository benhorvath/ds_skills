"9 reviews"	"ES175 Instrument & Data Product Support Specialist The ICE, Cloud, and Land Elevation, Satellite (ICESat-2) Mission is a laser altimeter with a single instrument, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) which launched September 15, 2018. High level science products will include measurements of the elevation of sea ice, ice sheets and glaciers, important to studies of the Earth's climate. The successful candidate will participate in the evaluation of the Science Unit Converted Telemetry (ATL02) product (Level 2b). This data product is a conversion of the Level 1a (ATL01) data product into times, voltages, temperatures and currents that are combined to calculate the photon time of flight and event times across the ATLAS data stream. The successful candidate will provide continued evaluation of that data product and refinement of the product as needs be. Specifically, the successful candidate will: Provide an assessment of the ATL02 data product, identifying any issues or discrepancies between the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD), the ATL02 data product, and the ATL02 verification code base. Provide an assessment of the ATLAS on-orbit performance, as indicated by the ATL02 data product. For those times and parameters when the ATL02 product is behaving as expected, the ATL02 product may be used to evaluate the state-of-health of the ATLAS instrument and any potential concerns regarding the on-orbit performance of ATLAS. In the event that ATLAS performance is not nominal, work with the Instrument Scientist to collect data, generate analysis products and recommend corrective actions. Remain up to date on the protocol for pre-launch data access and processing, and advise the government when such access and/or process capabilities are in danger of being compromised. Required Education: MS or higher in Aerospace Engineering, Physics or Earth Science Field Required Experience: At least ten years experience in spacecraft systems, instrument engineering, remote sensing data analysis, instrument pre-flight testing and operational trouble shooting MATLAB, IDL, Python, C++ experience is important Experience with satellite ground systems and data processing is important Experience with design, development, testing and operation of Laser-based instruments is important Demonstrated experience with NASA Laser-based, satellite-born instruments will be given high priority Must be US Citizen or Permanent Resident"	"4 days ago"	"character(0)"	2018-10-15	"Washington%2C+DC"	10
