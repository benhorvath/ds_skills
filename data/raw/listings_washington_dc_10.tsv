Our data scientists have a healthy mix of training, special projects, self-directed research, and of course client work. Much of our client work is defense related and requires a security clearance, though not everyone we hire will need one. The texture of training/projects/research/client work depends largely on the individual, in keeping with our philosophy of finding talented colleagues instead of starting with a list of line-item qualifications and looking for someone who fits them snugly on paper. Qualifications

Python, R, Hadoop, Spark, Random Forests, Deterministic Forests (jk), Jupyter Notebooks, xkcd, Deep Learning, and a host of other tools and techniques: you do not know them all, but you are comfortable and capable with quite a few of them. You likely have a degree in math/stats/computer science, but we also know that great data scientists sometimes come from outside those typical disciplines. You might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host, but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues. You have an entrepreneurial spirit driven by curiosity.
