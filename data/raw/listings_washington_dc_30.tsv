Title: Conflict Data Scientist
Location(s): Position Available in Washington DC
Security Clearance: Secret
Requirements: Immediate Opening
Background

This position is based in the United States Agency for International Development s (USAID) Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs (DCHA), in the Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM). DCHA/CMM provides technical advice and analysis that respond to the causes and consequences of conflict, fragility and violence to all parts of the Agency, other USG departments and agencies and international partners including other donors and civil society, with the objective of maximizing the effectiveness of conflict-sensitive development programs in this critical area. DCHA/CMM provides leadership on designing and implementing conflict-related programming through technical assistance to USAID field missions and other operating units, applied research and analysis, training and information dissemination, and donor engagement and coordination. The office links rigorous analysis to its assistance in strategy, program and activity design, and monitoring and evaluation, combining country and regional conflict assessments with practical guidance for program implementation. DCHA/CMM also spearheads the articulation of policy regarding the role of development vis-à-vis conflict, fragility and violence as well as the application of those policies within not only USAID but the interagency and the broader international community. In addition to providing direct field-based technical assistance, DCHA/CMM manages specialized grants, cooperative agreements, interagency agreements and contracts in support of country and regional programs.
DCHA/CMM currently manages USAID s early warning processes related to conflict, instability and diagnostics related to fragility. This work also supports broader conversations in the US government. DCHA/CMM seeks a Data Scientist to support its current early warning work and, as USAID transforms, to adapt and evolve DCHA/CMM s early warning capacity.

Responsibilities
The Data Scientist is responsible for working with subject matter experts on conflict, fragility and violence to support and enhance CMM s capacity to provide early warning of conflict and instability, diagnose fragility and to integrate data and analysis into routine decision making. It is anticipated that the Data Scientist will support the launch and use of the final annual iteration of its current early warning tools and data, help develop an interim set of early warning tools drawing from available US government and public resources to replicate the uses of the current tool, and serve as a technical advisor in the effort to adapt and evolve DCHA/CMM s early warning system.
Responsibilities will include:
Technical Support and Analytical Services

Apply data science techniques to support early warning on conflict and instability and diagnostics related to fragility and the relationship with international development challenges;
Assist USAID subject matter experts with data science focused analytical thinking for improved planning, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting of programs in conflict-affected and fragile environments.
Design, develop and deliver data analysis and visualization products to support DCHA/CMM s conflict, fragility and violence work, with an emphasis on early warning.
Acquire, process, manage, and analyze data from a range of sources for improved decision making in the areas of conflict, fragility and violence;
Collaborate with a team of interdisciplinary experts, particularly with USAID s GeoCenter, interagency partners and regional bureaus.
Develop and manage an interim early warning tool in coordination with technical staff in DCHA/CMM.

Strategic Planning, Support, and Capacity Building

Serve as technical advisor on team responsible for adapting and evolving early warning tools;
Provide consultation to non-technical audiences inside and outside USAID and develop and implement guidance on integrating data and analysis into work related to conflict, fragility and violence.
Prepare concept papers, background analyses, and briefings to build support for the use of data analytics and data science techniques in early warning on conflict and instability, and the dynamics related to fragility.
Participate in discussions among key USAID stakeholders to articulate a vision and plan for integrating data science into development work related to conflict, fragility and violence;
Provide training and capacity building services to non-technical audiences on accessing, analyzing, and visualizing data.

Skills and Capabilities
The Data Scientist will demonstrate experience and expertise in the following technical areas:

An advanced quantitative degree such as Statistics, Physics, Math, Computer Science, Economics, Engineering, or related technical field
Strong quantitative background and experience in data collection, cleaning, processing and applied analysis and visualization using statistical software or programming languages (Python, Stata, SAS, R, SPSS, MATLAB, Tableau, PowerBI)
Ability to produce compelling data visualization products using Adobe applications, such as Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign
Ability to create interactive web-based products using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Curious, self-motivated individual with excellent communications skills - must be able to distill highly technical quantitative methods into policy relevant snippets
Experience translating statistical, regression and visualization results into briefing documents or presentations for senior leadership
Experience working on data science as it pertains to conflict, fragility and violence within the foreign policy realm.
Experience applying data science analytical techniques to foreign policy and programming.
Ability to apply data science analytical techniques to problems and data sets spanning diverse sectors as agriculture, democracy & governance, economic growth, education, environment, and health
