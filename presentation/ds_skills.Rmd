# Introduction


## Purpose:

"Which are the most valued data science skills?""



## Analytic Strategy

1. Scrape many job listings for data scientists from an online job web site

2. Prepare and clean data for analysis

3. Develop a list of data science hard and soft skills

4. Analyze:

    - Find the most commonly listed skills
    
    - Where salary information is available, compute the mean salary for each skill
